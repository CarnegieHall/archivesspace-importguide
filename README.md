# ch-archivesspace-importguide

## OVERVIEW
Carnegie Hall (CH) Archives is assessing ArchivesSpace as a potential internal tool for storing, managing, and browsing its paper collections' metadata and finding aids. We established a procedure and documentation to import test records into ArchivesSpace as Resources. The CH Archives [ArchivesSpace import guide](https://github.com/marcolock/archivesspace-importguide/blob/master/archivesspace-import.md) illustrates how to convert  records from the *Excel Spreadsheets* to *EAD XML* and how to import well formed EAD to ArchivesSpace, proposing a schematic workflow for the ingest of data.
