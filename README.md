# ch-archivesspace-importguide

## OVERVIEW
Carnegie Hall Archives is using ArchivesSpace for internal needs to store and browse the Finding Aids of its paper collections. To import them in ArchivesSpace as Resources we have established this procedure. The [guide](https://github.com/marcolock/archivesspace-importguide/blob/master/archivesspace-import.md) illustrate how to convert the records in the Excel Spreadsheets in EAD Xml and how to import the well formed EAD in ArchivesSpace, proposing a schematic workflow for the ingest of data.
