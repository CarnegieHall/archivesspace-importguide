## START ARCHIVESsPACE

To start the Demo version of AS we need to execute manually the directory of the program. To run the program just execute on the terminal one of these scripts. This will start ArchivesSpace in foreground model, so you need to keep open the Terminal window (and if you close it the program shut down). You need to have Java 1.6 (or newer).
