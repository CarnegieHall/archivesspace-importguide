## START ARCHIVESsPACE

To start the Demo version of AS we need to execute manually the directory of the program. To run the program just execute on the terminal one of these scripts. This will start ArchivesSpace in foreground model, so you need to keep open the Terminal window (and if you close it the program shut down). You need to have Java 1.6 (or newer). 

| OSX and LINUX | Windowstable test|
| -----------|-----------|
| cd /path/to/archivesspace 
./archivesspace.sh | cd /path/to/archivesspace ./archivesspace.sh|
  
You can also drag and drop the AS folder from the Applications to the Terminal, instead of write the path to the program, as it shown in the image below. The path will automatically appear.

It will take a while to run completely the program, and once itâ€™s ready you can access the system by one of these URL links in your internet browser:

A detailed description is on the GitHub web-page of AS, linked here below.
